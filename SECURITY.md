# Security Policy

## DevSecOps Security Practices

### 1. Code Security
- **SAST Scanning**: Static analysis with SonarQube/CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: OWASP Dependency Check for vulnerable libraries
- **Secret Scanning**: Gitleaks for credential detection
- **Code Quality**: Automated code quality gates

### 2. Container Security
- **Base Image Security**: Use minimal, updated base images
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Trivy for container image scanning
- **Image Signing**: Cosign for container image signing
- **Non-root Execution**: Run containers as non-root user
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Reduce attack surface

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **IaC Scanning**: Checkov for infrastructure as code
- **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret storage (not in code)
- **Access Control**: Implement least privilege access

### 4. Runtime Security
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks
- **Log Monitoring**: Security event logging
- **Incident Response**: Automated rollback procedures

### 5. Compliance
- **Security Gates**: Mandatory security checks before deployment
- **Audit Trail**: Complete deployment audit logs
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular security updates
